# Suitepad
Suitepad test project

#Journey
First time I did the way project demands, it is interesting. like connecting to AWS and creating instance.
Although I am able to create instance but not able to create user as the SDK of Net:SSH have issues.
But If you see my coding style and code,the way i believ is 
I strongly believe this "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand" -Martin Fowler. You will get to know the way i write.
I used: AWS SDK, Net:SSH SDK for this project.
